# Multiple Sequence Alignment Using Clustal Omega
ClustalW is a general purpose DNA or protein multiple sequence alignment program for three or more sequences. Clustal Omega is a new multiple sequence alignment program that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile techniques to generate alignments between three or more sequences.

Includes 3 steps

## 1. Getting the orthologs.
Search for APOE protein in the NCBI database and download the orthologous sequences. 
## 2. Translate the nucleotide to amino acid sequences. 
Translate the FASTA files into amino acid sequences. 
## 3. Perform Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using Clustal Omega. 
Align the APOE orthologs using Clustal Omega.
